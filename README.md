**Comparative Analysis of Existing Approaches for Evaluating Cloud Security**

 # Project Description
 
In the past decade, there has been a significant shift towards the adoption of cloud computing plaforms in large, networked software systems. Cloud computing offers a number of useful benefits in terms of flexibility and scalability. However, it also bring a new frontier of security concerns and challenges. This has led to the
development of a range of cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and best practices dedicated to addressing issues of cloud security. In addition, a number of approaches for evaluating the security of cloud-based systems have been proposed. In this project, we aim to study the effectiveness of such approaches and to identify whether the challenges or limitations of cloud security evaluation result from the ineffectiveness of the evaluation approaches or from the standards themselves.


# Project Objectives

1. Develop an understanding of the relevant standards, guidelines and best practices related to cloud security and approaches for evaluating compliance with these documents.
2. Develop a set of evaluation criteria with which we can compare existing approaches for evaluating cloud security with respect to compliance to existing standards.
3. Perform a comparative analysis to study the effectiveness of existing cloud security evaluation approaches with respect to compliance to existing standards.
4. Propose a set of recommendations for improving the state-of-the-art of cloud security evaluation.



### Literature Survey: Cloud Security Standards

For this deliverable, I report on existing standards, guidelines, and best practices related to cloud security. The purpose of this literature review is for me to become familiar with existing cloud security standards and what they prescribe and/or recommend. I provide a critical evaluation of the standards, highlighting similarities and differences, and strengths and weaknesses.

### Literature Survey: Cloud Security Evaluation Approaches

For this deliverable, I report on existing approaches for evaluating cloud security. The purpose of this literature review is for me to have identified a collection of approaches that are compared as part of my analysis. I provide a description of each of the identified approaches and a justification for its inclusion or exclusion for my comparative analysis. 

### Comparative Analysis Methodology

For this deliverable, I clearly describe my comparative analysis methodology. This involves describing the evaluation criteria that forms the basis for comparison, the scales that are used, and the general procedure for performing the comparisons in a fair, objective, and repeatable manner.

### Final Project Report

The final report represents the culmination of my work. In this deliverable, I present,in detail, a full description of my comparative analysis, the methodology adopted, and the results of the analysis. The final project report also provide a summary of my conclusions and recommendations for improving the state-of-the-art of cloud security evaluation.
